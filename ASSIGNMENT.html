            <h1>WORLD WIDE WEB</h1>
            <p> The World Wide Web (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.
                Everything there is online about W3 is linked directly or indirectly to this document, including an executive summary of the project, Mailing lists, policy, November's W3 news, Frequently Asked Questions.
        
            </p>
            <h2> What's out there?</h2>
            <p> The World Wide Web project uses URLs and hyperlinks to connect users to online resources. Search engines index and provide access to vast amounts of information. Web directories categorize websites by subjects. </p>
            <p> W3 servers host web content using protocols like HTTP. HTML and metadata help structure and describe web pages. Together, these elements facilitate navigation, information retrieval, and content sharing on the web.</p>

            <p> Pointers to the world's online information, subjects, W3 servers, etc</p>

            <h2> Technical</h2>
            <h3> PROTOCOLS</h3>
            <p> The World Wide Web relies on key protocols such as HTTP for communication, HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. URLs are used to identify web resources, DNS translates domain names to IP addresses, and TLS ensures secure communication. These protocols work together to facilitate the retrieval, rendering, and interaction with web content.</p>
            <h3> FORMAT</h3>
            <p> The World Wide Web project uses HTML for structuring web documents, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. These formats, along with protocols like HTTP and URLs, enable the exchange and presentation of information on the web.</p>
            <h3> PROGRAM INTERNALS</h3>
            <p> The World Wide Web project encompasses various program internals that contribute to its functioning. Some of the key components include:</p>
            <p> <b> ~Web Servers:</b></p>
            <p> Web servers are software programs that respond to client requests for web resources. They handle incoming requests, retrieve the requested files or data, and send the response back to the client.</p>
            <p> <b> ~Web Browsers</b></p>
            <p> Web browsers are applications that retrieve and display web content. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.</p>
            <p> <b> ~Web Development Frameworks</b></p>
            <p> Web development frameworks provide libraries, tools, and pre-defined structures to streamline the creation of web applications. Examples of web frameworks include Django, Ruby on Rails, and React.js.</p>

            <h2> A summary of the history of the project</h2>
            <p> The World Wide Web (WWW) project, initiated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN, aimed to create a global system for accessing and sharing information over computer networks. The project introduced a set of technologies, protocols, and standards that revolutionized the way we navigate, interact with, and disseminate information on the internet.</p>


            <p>The World Wide Web project introduced a decentralized and open model for information sharing. It enabled anyone with an internet connection to create and publish web content, fostering a democratic platform for the dissemination of knowledge and ideas.</p>


            <p>The impact of the World Wide Web has been profound, transforming communication, commerce, education, and many other aspects of society. It has facilitated global connectivity, facilitated e-commerce, empowered social networking, and revolutionized the way we access and share information. Today, the World Wide Web continues to evolve, with ongoing developments in web technologies, security, accessibility, and user experience, shaping the digital landscape and driving innovation across various industries.</p>
